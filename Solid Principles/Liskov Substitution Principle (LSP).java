Introduction
There is a set of five principles for writing clean, scalable, maintainable object-oriented code. These principles are known as SOLID principles. The L in SOLID stands for Liskov Substitution Principle.
Definition:
If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering the correctness of the program.
This means that any subclass should be substitutable for its parent class without breaking the functionality.

Think of it like this:
If you write code using a parent class (say Shape), and later swap in a child class (using the child class object in place of the parent class object) (like Circle), the code should still work without errors or unexpected behavior.
If the subclass changes behavior in a way that breaks expectations, it violates LSP

Real-life Analogy
Imagine you run a pet hotel, and you have a general policy - “Any pet staying here must be able to be fed, walked, and groomed.”
So you design your hotel to handle pets - and you've had dogs, cats, and rabbits as guests, and things work fine.
Problem
Assume someone brings in a pet snake. Here are the issues:
You try to walk it. Can't.
You try to groom it. Doesn't make sense.
You offer pet food. Snake needs live mice.

Suddenly, your normal pet hotel process breaks. Your system expected all pets to behave like dogs or cats, but this snake breaks the assumptions. This creates an LSP Violation.
A Valid Substitution
If instead someone brings in a pet hamster - it still eats food, needs care, and maybe doesn't walk outside, but it still fits within the expected “pet” behavior. You just make a minor adjustment (like putting it in a wheel instead of walking it). Still fine - no big surprises.
Understanding
The pet hotel needs to trust that any "pet" will behave in expected ways. If a new pet completely changes the rules, the whole system becomes fragile.

That's exactly what the Liskov Substitution Principle protects us from in software - making sure substituting one thing for another doesn't break the expected behavior.

Example: LSP Violation
Let's illustrate this with the classic Rectangle-Square example, which is a famous LSP violation case. Consider the code given below:
Java


// Rectangle class
class Rectangle {
    int width, height;

    void setWidth(int w) { width = w; }
    void setHeight(int h) { height = h; }
    int getArea() { return width * height; }
}

// Square class extending the Rectangle class
class Square extends Rectangle {
    @Override 
    void setWidth(int w) {
        width = w;
        height = w; // makes it a square
    }

    @Override
    void setHeight(int h) {
        height = h;
        width = h; // makes it a square
    }
}

// Main class
class Main {
    //  main method
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Replacing object of Rectangle class with Square class
        Rectangle r = new Square();
        
        // Method call to print the area of the rectangle
        printArea(r);
    }
    
    // Method to print the area of the given rectangle object
    private static void printArea(Rectangle r) {
        r.setWidth(5);
        r.setHeight(10);
        System.out.println(r.getArea()); // Expected: 50 but Actual: 100
    }
}

In the above code:
Square class is a subclass of Rectangle class.
The printArea() function takes a Rectangle object as an argument and prints its area.
To demonstrate the violation of LSP, the object of Rectangle class is replaced with the object of Square class.
Violation
Expected Output: 50
Actual Output: 100 (since both the width and height became 10)

So, the Square violates LSP because it changes the behavior of setWidth and setHeight, breaking the assumptions of the parent class.

Need of LSP
Consider the example of a Notification system:
Java


// Notification class
class Notification {
    // method implementing send notification functionality 
    public void sendNotification() {
        System.out.println("Notification sent");
    }
}

// Main class
class Main {
    //  main method
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Creating an object of Notification class
        Notification notification = new Notification();
        
        // Working code on the notification object
        notification.sendNotification();
    }
}

Assume we wish to introduce some new type of notifications, say Email Notification or Text Notification.

In such a case, we can create a new class for each type of notification, and we can easily extend the system without breaking existing code using the Liskov Substitution Principle.
Java


// Notification class
class Notification {
    // method implementing send notification functionality 
    public void sendNotification() {
        System.out.println("Notification sent");
    }
}

// Subclass of Notification class for Email Notification
class EmailNotification extends Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification() {
        System.out.println("Email Notification sent");
    }
}

// Subclass of Notification class for Text Notification
class TextNotification extends Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification() {
        System.out.println("Text Notification sent");
    }
}


// Main class
class Main {
    //  main method
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        /* Replaced the Notification class object
        with one of its subclass' objects */
        Notification notification = new EmailNotification();
        
        // Working code on the notification object
        notification.sendNotification();
    }
}

Here, the only change needed for introducing two different types of the notification system is to create two subclasses of the Notification class with overriden sendNotification() method. The main class can remain unchanged. The only change needed in the main method is the declaration of notification object.

This is the power of LSP. It allows us to extend our system without breaking existing code.

Why Does LSP Matter?
When LSP is violated, the code becomes:
Unpredictable: Code relying on base class assumptions will break with certain subclasses.
Hard to Maintain: Adding new subclasses requires rechecking all usages.
Bug-Prone: Runtime errors, wrong outputs, or inconsistent behavior.
Less Reusable: Substituting child objects becomes dangerous.
Tight Coupling: Client code ends up getting tightly coupled to specific types, making it less maintainable.

Hence, to avoid these problems while working on a huge codebase, it is recommended to follow the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) (wherever possible).

How to Spot LSP Violations?
To spot LSP violations, ask yourself these questions:
Does the subclass override methods in a way that changes meaning or assumptions?
Can I replace the base class with the subclass everywhere without changing expected behavior or breaking correctness?
Does the subclass throw unexpected exceptions or return wrong values?
Does the subclass weaken any preconditions or strengthen postconditions?

If the answer to any of these questions is "yes", there might be a LSP violation in the code.

Key Principles to Follow
There are some key principles to follow to avoid LSP violations. These are:
Subclasses should honor the contract (expectations) of the parent class.
Avoid overriding methods in a way that changes behavior drastically.
Prefer composition over inheritance when possible.
Think in terms of interfaces and behavioral compatibility.
Subclass should only extend, not restrict behavior.
