Introduction
Structural design patterns are concerned with the composition of classes and objects. They help make large systems more efficient, scalable, and maintainable. The Flyweight Pattern is one such structural pattern that focuses on optimizing memory usage and performance by sharing objects. Let's understand it in detail.
Flyweight Pattern
The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

It separates the intrinsic (shared) state from the extrinsic (unique) state, so that shared parts of objects are stored only once and reused wherever needed.
Real-Life Analogy
Think of trees in a video game. In an open-world video game, you might see thousands of trees:
All oak trees have the same texture, shape, and behavior (shared/intrinsic).
But their location, size, or health status may differ (extrinsic).

Rather than loading the same tree model thousands of times, the game engine uses a single shared tree model and passes different parameters when rendering.
Problem It Solves
It solves the problem of high memory usage when a large number of similar objects are created. For example, imagine a system rendering:
Thousands of tree objects in a forest
Each with the same shape and texture but a different location

Instead of creating thousands of identical objects, the Flyweight Pattern lets you share the common parts (shape, texture) and store the unique parts (location) externally, dramatically reducing memory consumption.
Core Concepts
Intrinsic State: The immutable, shared data stored inside the flyweight. It is independent of context.
Extrinsic State: The context-specific data passed from the client and not stored in the flyweight.

Real-Life Coding Example
Imagine you're building a feature like Google Maps where you need to visually represent trees across the globe. Now, even though millions of trees are shown, most of them belong to only a few common types like “Oak”, “Pine”, or “Birch”. However, if we were to create a separate object for each individual tree — storing the same data repeatedly for tree type, color, and texture — it would lead to massive memory consumption.

Let’s consider a scenario where we want to create 1 million trees, all with the same name, color, and texture. A poor design would look like this:
Bad Design: Without Flyweight
Java


import java.util.*;

// ================ Tree Class =================
class Tree {
    // Attributes that keep on changing 
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    // Attributes that remain constant
    private String name;
    private String color;
    private String texture;
    
    public Tree(int x, int y, String name, String color, String texture) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.texture = texture;
    }
    
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing tree at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with type " + name);
    }
}

// ================ Forest Class =================
class Forest {

    private List<Tree> trees = new ArrayList<>();

    public void plantTree(int x, int y, String name, String color, String texture) {
        Tree tree = new Tree(x, y, name, color, texture);
        trees.add(tree);
    }

    public void draw() {
        for (Tree tree : trees) {
            tree.draw();
        }
    }
}

// =============== Client Code ==================
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Forest forest = new Forest();
        
        // Planting 1 million trees
        for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            forest.plantTree(i, i, "Oak", "Green", "Rough");
        }
        
        System.out.println("Planted 1 million trees.");
    }
}
Understanding the Issues
Although the above codes works absolutely fine but there are a few problems associated with it:
Redundant memory usage: Same tree data duplicated a million times.
Inefficient: Slower rendering, higher GC overhead.

The previous implementation created a new Tree object for each of the 1 million trees, even when most of them had identical properties like name, color, and texture. This led to unnecessary duplication of memory for the shared attributes.

To solve this, we use the Flyweight Design Pattern — a structural pattern focused on minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects.

Good Design: Using Flyweight Pattern
Java


import java.util.*;

// ============= TreeType Class ================
class TreeType {
    // Properties that are common among all trees of this type
    private String name;
    private String color;
    private String texture;

    public TreeType(String name, String color, String texture) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.texture = texture;
    }

    public void draw(int x, int y) {
        System.out.println("Drawing " + name + " tree at (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
    }
}


// ================ Tree Class =================
class Tree {
    // Attributes that keep on changing 
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    // Attributes that remain constant
    private TreeType treeType;
    
    public Tree(int x, int y, TreeType treeType) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.treeType = treeType;
    }
    
    public void draw() {
        treeType.draw(x, y);
    }
}


// ============ TreeFactory Class ==============
class TreeFactory {

    static Map<String, TreeType> treeTypeMap = new HashMap<>();

    public static TreeType getTreeType(String name, String color, String texture) {
        String key = name + " - " + color + " - " + texture;

        if (!treeTypeMap.containsKey(key)) {
            treeTypeMap.put(key, new TreeType(name, color, texture));
        }
        return treeTypeMap.get(key);
    }
}


// ================ Forest Class =================
class Forest {
    private List<Tree> trees = new ArrayList<>();

    public void plantTree(int x, int y, String name, String color, String texture) {
        Tree tree = new Tree(x, y, TreeFactory.getTreeType(name, color, texture));
        trees.add(tree);
    }

    public void draw() {
        for (Tree tree : trees) {
            tree.draw();
        }
    }
}


// =============== Client Code ==================
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Forest forest = new Forest();
        
        // Planting 1 million trees
        for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            forest.plantTree(i, i, "Oak", "Green", "Rough");
        }
        
        System.out.println("Planted 1 million trees.");
    }
}
How Flyweight Pattern Solves the Issue
Let’s break it down:
TreeType Class: This acts as the flyweight object. It stores data common to all trees of a given type—like name, color, and texture. Instead of duplicating this data, we create only one instance per unique combination.
Tree Class: This now only stores:
Intrinsic data: x, y (unique to each tree)
Reference to shared data: A TreeType instance
TreeFactory Class: This is the central factory that ensures TreeType instances are reused:
Memory Efficiency: Even with 1 million trees, if they all share the same TreeType ("Oak", "Green", "Rough"), only one TreeType object is created and shared across all trees, reducing memory usage dramatically.

When to Use Flyweight Pattern?
The flyweight pattern can be used when:
When you need to create a large number of similar objects.
When memory and performance optimization is crucial.
When the object's intrinsic properties could be shared independently of its extrinsic properties.

Advantages
A few advantages of using the Flyweight Pattern are:
Greatly reduces memory usage when there are a lot of similar objects.
Improves performance in resource-constrained environments.
Enables faster object creation.

Disadvantages
A few disadvantages of using the Flyweight Pattern are:
Adds complexity (especially around factory and object management).
Harder to debug due to shared state.
Can lead to tight coupling between flyweight and client code if not designed carefully.

Real-World Applications of Flyweight Pattern
The Flyweight pattern is widely used in large-scale applications where rendering or managing many similar objects efficiently is essential. Here are some real-world examples:
1. Google Maps
When displaying millions of trees or similar visual landmarks, Google Maps avoids creating separate objects for each tree. Instead, it shares the same data (like tree type, color, texture) across all trees and only varies extrinsic properties like position — a classic use of the Flyweight pattern.
2. Uber App
Uber renders many nearby cars on the map, but most of them are visually identical (same icon, color, etc.). Instead of creating a new object for each car from scratch, Uber reuses a common flyweight object and just changes the coordinates — reducing memory and improving performance.
3. Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
When rendering complex webpages with thousands of similar DOM elements (like repeated icons, buttons, text styles), modern browsers internally use the Flyweight pattern to optimize memory. For instance:
A webpage might have hundreds of <div> or <button> elements styled identically.
Instead of allocating separate memory for each element’s styling and behavior, browsers reuse the same shared style object (like CSS rules or rendering data) across all similar components.
This allows browsers to load and display large webpages faster and with less RAM usage.
